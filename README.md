## How's The Weather?

A simple app I created using the GeoDB cities and OpenWeatherMap APIs. It uses react-select-async-paginate to bring up a list of cities that match the parameters I set. It also gives the user the next week's forecast under the current weather's forecast component. I styled it using Tailwind CSS.
